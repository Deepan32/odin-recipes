    <h2>Description:</h2>
    <p>The Rasam is a famous Indian dish. Its a spicy and full flavoured dish which is mostly eaten for lunch along with curd, onion which is called Raita
        and a brinjal gravy. The History of Rasam dates back to mogals. But relax we are not going there.. Chicken or mutton is added as a main ingredient. 
        Some people go for vegetable Biriyani also but it is not technically a right word meaning that Biriyani is only a non-veg dish 
    </p>

    <p>The rice in Rasam soru should be Basmathi or a high quality grain which is also a main ingedient. Apart from non-veg pieces and rice, the other main ingredient
        is ghee and coconut oil. There are many types of Biriyanis available in India.
